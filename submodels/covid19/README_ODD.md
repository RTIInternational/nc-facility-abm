## ODD Documentation

The COVID-19 related ODD will be published soon.

### Recreate Results

To create the output used in the ODD, run the following:

```bash
source python_env/bin/activate
python submodels/covid19/src/targets.py
```

This will take 1-2 minutes.

Go to `submodels/covid19/experiments/base/scenario_base/run_0` to see the model output. Files are labeled by the pattern they correspond to.
